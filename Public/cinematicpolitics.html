            <p>Sadly, in the Cinematic Universe, this had complications to it. Marvel had sold the rights to the Mutants to Fox. To circumnavigate this issue, the Cinematic Universe positioned her as a Witch (because of her name, this was believable), and not a Mutant. They also could not utilize the alias Scarlet Witch since the rights belonged to Fox, but the name Wanda Maximoff was still available to be used.</p>

            <p>Recently though, Disney (who now owns Marvel) has worked out an agreement with Fox to utilize some of their resources that have been deemed crucial to the expansion of the Cinematic universe. This has granted Marvel the ability to slowly incorporate the Mutants into the Cinematic universe without infringing on any rights belonging to Fox. Thus, Wanda Maximoff has finally and recently re-earned her long-running alias “The Scarlet Witch” in the Cinematic Universe.</p>

        <p>Disney Acquired Fox through a buyout of $71.3 billion. It was first announced back in December of 2017, and didn’t get finalized until March 2019. This gave Disney the rights to not only the X-Men/ mutants, but Deadpool, Fantastic Four, the Silver Surfer, and more. This purchase gave Disney the rights to Fox’s assets for streaming as well, which helped Disney add Fox’s old repertoire to their Disney + Streaming service as well.</p>

        <p>While purchasing Fox was an impressively large and expensive move for Disney, doing the same for the acquisition of Sony’s Spider-Man and the characters that are included is not quite as likely. Sony has no intention of being bought, nor will they yield the rights to Spider-Man at anything akin to a worthwhile price.</p>
