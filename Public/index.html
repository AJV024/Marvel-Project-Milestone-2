            <p>Hello! Welcome to my Marvel Web page. While everyone knows of the Avengers, what is lesser known is the differences between how the Original Comics portray the (Enigmatic?) Superheroes, and how (and why) the Cinematic Universe has developed them. This page aims to share these intriguing details about everyone’s beloved heroes.</p>

            <p>In the Cinematic Universe, Wanda Maximoff is an orphan alongside her brother Pietro. Wanda and Pietro’s parents were unmentioned (potentially tying them to the mutants at a later date pending an agreement with Fox). Pietro retained his ability for super speed, but Wanda’s powers were only vaguely referenced: The ability to alter memories, force fields, and telekinesis. All simple powers, assuring that no infringement of rights happened.</p>

            <p>Fox was bought by Disney in December of 2017, meaning that Disney can finally start including them into their Marvel Cinematic universe. Due to the fact that the Mutants were not originally included in the Cinematic Universe, Marvel has been cleverly veering into the Multiverse saga to impressively introduce a whole new species of humanoid into their current universe (the mutants of course!).</p>

            <p>The rights to Spider-Man were bought by Sony in 1998 to help Marvel stave off bankruptcy. In this trade of ownership, Sony obtained rights to Spider-Man, and a myriad of villains that he has faced, but that’s it. This led to an interesting Sony Spider Universe, which is Sony’s attempt at replicating Marvel’s success, without outright giving its rights away. In doing so, Sony has been adding anti-heroes to its list of heroes in the form of Venom and Madame Web. In this way, Spidey can have his own heroes to work with.</p>
