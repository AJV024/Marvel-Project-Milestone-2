            <p>In the comics, Maximoff is known as The Scarlet Witch. She is the daughter of Magneto, and she is considered one of the strongest mutants of all time. Scarlet Witch (as the comic book world knows her as, less Wanda) is a proud member of numerous teams: The Avengers, A-Force, Holy Guard…. The list goes on and on.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <div class="content-text" style="text-align: right;">
            <p>Due to the fact that the Scarlet Witch is multi-faceted, her affiliations have even been evil. She was in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and even the main antagonist in The House of M. The House of M is an extraordinary segment of Marvel comic history that takes place after she goes insane from the death of her unborn children, and she rewrites the entire universe – deleting X-Men from history.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
            <p>X-Men work and fight alongside the Avengers and other comic book heroes. They don’t have their own universe, meaning that their world is directly affected by the other characters from the other teams. In fact, there have even been battles between the X-Men and the Avengers in the past.</p>

        <div class="content-text">
            <p>Spidey frequently works with others like Deadpool (Owned by Sony), the Avengers, and X-Men to defend his hometown of New York. He has been known to have comically funny interactions with the likes of Wolverine and Deadpool, adding credibility to his appeal to kids for his light-hearted air of hilarity and relatability.</p>
